# What i learned today
## CSS Flexbox Gallery Assignment
## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a responsive image gallery using CSS Flexbox.
## Development Hurdles & Breakthroughs
I mistaked justify-content for align-items, was trying to center my images to the center of my web page with align-items and forgot that it only works on the cross axis and my images(content) are on the main axis. Gave me little issue which resulted in asking for help from a snr dev, which he explained more about the main and cross axes to me and i understood well and also found out that if i want it to be the other way round,
 so align-items will do the work of justify-content "i would change it from flex-direction:row; to flex-direction:column;". Also mistaked text-shadow for box-shadow and font-size for transform:scale()😭 but have learned from my mistake and now know the right way to do things so learnt that I realized that using horizontal and vertical offsets (10px 10px) makes an element look like a sticker peeling off a wall. By setting both offsets to 0 and only using a 20px blur, I created a "Radial Glow". This ensures the light radiates evenly in all directions, keeping the focus perfectly centered on the image without leaning to one side.
